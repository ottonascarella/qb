What is QB?

- QB is a small library to work with SVG.
- It was built because popular JS libraries are not designed to deal with SVGElements, and the ones that are designed to do have large files and offer tools that are not always a requirement - like animation, events, data, etc...

What QB is not:

- An animation framework. We recommend GSAP to do that.
- An API for events. Use your favourite framework to do that for you...or go wild with old good VanillaJS.
